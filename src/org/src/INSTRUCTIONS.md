# Code Review Exercise

Take a look at the code within this package and review it like you would do in a real life situation for a pull request. You can take notes if you want, but it's not necessary. We'll then discuss the code in the interview. You can also think about how would you refactor this code.

For the sake of this exercise, this "pull request" was submitted with the following description:

## Add stats sync for last 30 days

Adds a library function that syncs an account's stats from Example stats api for the last 30 days and saves them to the database.
